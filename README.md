# Scenario

With Eclipse Equinox OSGi Framework, we have created an Online Marketplace and Delivery System. Four Producers make up the system: a grocery store, a vegetable and fruit store, a meat and fish store, a pharmacy, a delivery service, and one consumer. The rationale behind having just one consumer bundle is because if multiple consumer bundles are built, they will all behave identically, amounting to redundant consumer bundle implementation. Eclipse, an IDE built for the Java programming language, was utilized.


        • Upon entering the program, the user is prompted to input their name.
        • The system then requests the user to type 'use' in order to proceed.
        • If the user wishes to stop the process, they can type 'no', or they can type 'yes' to continue the process.
        • The system then prompts the user for available section details.
        • The user can purchase an item by selecting any of the sections (Grocery/Fruit and Vegetable/Meat and Fish).
        • The system displays the invoice.
        • The user can then navigate to the Pharmacy area and purchase items; the system will display the available items in             the pharmacy.
        • The system displays the invoice.
        • The user must provide delivery information.
        • The technology generates discounts based on the user's location and distance from the city of Colombo.
        • The user can then complete the payment and submit the receipt number.
